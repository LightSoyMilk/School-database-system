- The main reason to split the data into separate tables is to achieve normalization:
+ Ensure that each table has relevant information accordingly to the title 
+ There is no dependency for information (i.e the data on courses should exist
irrespective of students' enrollment since a course can be offered but no students take it)
+ Makes it easier to control and update information, when a student drops a course, the information
about that course is not deleted

- The table connects to each other through foreign keys present in the enrollment table.
-> This solves the issue of data duplication. As the enrollment table fixes the issue of students 
enrolling in multiple courses. If we did not have the enrollment table, we would have to connect the 
courses and students table directly. This would inevitably result in a student, or course information 
being repeated to accomodate a course having more than 1 student in it, or a student enrolling in 
more than 1 course.
